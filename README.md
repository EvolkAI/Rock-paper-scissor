Rock, Paper, Scissors ML: Uses computer vision to play the game. Trained on hand gesture images, a CNN identifies rock, paper, or scissors in real-time video. Tracks hands, determines moves, and displays results. Showcasing AI's gesture recognition and interactivity.

The Rock, Paper, Scissors Object Detection Project is an exciting application of machine learning techniques that enables a computer system to play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a human opponent. Leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning algorithms, this project aims to accurately detect and classify hand gestures as rock, paper, or scissors in real-time.

The project utilizes a variety of machine learning technologies to achieve its goal. Initially, a large dataset of annotated images is collected, consisting of hands displaying various rock, paper, and scissors gestures from different angles, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. This dataset serves as the training data for the deep learning model.

The next step involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN), a popular architecture for image classification tasks, to recognize and distinguish between the different hand gestures. The CNN is trained on the labeled dataset, learning the visual patterns and features that differentiate rock, paper, and scissors.

To enhance the accuracy and robustness of the model, data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, translations, and scaling may be employed to artificially increase the diversity of the training data. This helps the model generalize better to unseen images and variations in hand gestures.

Once the model is trained, it is deployed on a real-time video processing system. The system uses a webcam or any suitable camera input to capture the live video feed. The frames of the video are then fed into the trained model, which processes each frame and performs hand gesture detection and classification.

The system identifies and tracks the hand region in each frame, leveraging object detection algorithms such as Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) or You Only Look Once (YOLO). Once the hand region is identified, the CNN classifies the gesture as rock, paper, or scissors based on the learned features.

The classification output is then used to determine the computer's move in the game. A decision-making algorithm is employed to implement a strategy for the computer's gameplay. It analyzes the player's move and selects the optimal counter-move based on predefined rules or heuristics.

The game interface can be presented through a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI) where the human player can interact with the system by making their hand gestures. The computer's move and the game's outcome (win, lose, or draw) are displayed in real-time, providing an engaging experience for the players.
